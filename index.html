  <p class="pbold">
    <span class="italiclorem">Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the
    printing and typesetting industry. <span class="italiclorem">Lorem Ipsum</span> has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
    galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
    the release of Letraset sheets containing <span class="italiclorem">Lorem Ipsum</span> passages, and more recently
    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
    Ipsum.</p>
